      <p style="font-size:1.3rem; line-height:1.6;">Hi, my name is Dorji Khandu. rom Merak, a remote village in eastern Bhutan, situated in the Trashigang district, renowned for its rich and unique culture and traditions.
         Growing up in such a vibrant environment has instilled in me a deep appreciation for my heritage. I enjoy playing online quizzes, which challenge my knowledge and critical thinking skills, and I have a passion for
          creative arts, where I express myself through drawing and painting. Data visualization fascinates me as it combines creativity with analytical thinking, allowing me to present information in engaging ways. 
           I cherish spending quality time with my parents and friends, whether it’s playing online games or participating in various physical activities like soccer. I strive to be gentle and interactive 
           with my environment, embracing every opportunity to learn and grow through my experiences. I’m a passionate web developer who loves turning ideas into interactive digital experiences. I'm constantly learning new technologies to expand my skill set.</p>
